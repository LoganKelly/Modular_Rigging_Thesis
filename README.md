This is the modular rigging system for Maya that I developed as part of my master's thesis work at Texas A&M University. The rigging system uses XML files to store the rig definitions, and sets up a metadata node network in Maya in order to create, update, and remove rigs from the Maya scene. For more information see my thesis paper at:
