This is the modular rigging system for Maya that I developed as part of my master's thesis work at Texas A&M University. The rigging system uses XML files to store the rig definitions, and sets up a metadata node network in Maya in order to create, update, and remove rigs from the Maya scene. For more information see my thesis paper at:

<b> Requirements </b>

The python scripts were developed for use in Maya 2012. The C++ plugins have dependencies on Boost 1.47 and RapidXML 1.13. The plugins were compiled in Windows 7 using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Compatibility with different software or API versions may be possible, but is not guaranteed.
